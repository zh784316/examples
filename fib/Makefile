build: main

# This is the target that link together object files
# to craete the executable named main.
# It is called main (the same name as the target) so
# if the file is already exist and there is no changes
# in its dependecy, the command will not run.

# This target depends on main.o since it uses this
# object file to create an executable.

# LDFLAGS is used because this command only link object file to an executable file.
# $@ is referring to main (the name of the target).
# $< refers to main.o (the first entry in the dependency list of this target).

clean:
# '-' is used to ignore error if any occur.
